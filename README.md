# Monte-Carlo-Localization
 Java implementation of Sebastian Thrun's Monte Carlo Localization from Probabilistic Robotics
 Project contains a java swing gui to visualize mapping and localization.
 This repository is the product of the work I did for FRC Team 766 with a raspberry pi and a Scanse Sweep LiDAR.
