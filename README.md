# Monte-Carlo-Localization
 Java implementation of Sebastian Thrun's Monte Carlo Localization from Probabilistic Robotics
 Project contains a java swing gui to visualize mapping and localization.
 This repository is the product of the work I did for FRC Team 766 with a raspberry pi and a Scanse Sweep LiDAR.

 How to use: type ./gradlew run in terminal (while in /Monte-Carlo-Localization) to run application
 All dependencies will be handled by gradle
 Press WASD to translate the robot's true position (the location from which the scan data is generated) and to send a motion update
